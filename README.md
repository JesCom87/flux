### Computer Science
#### Layers of Abstraction

#### Number Systems

- Number Systems: Decimal = 0-9, Binary = 0, 1, Octal = 0-8, Hexidecimal = 1-9 and a-f.

- There are Conversions for each pair.

- Each Number System has a: Radix, Base, Weight.

- The Radix is the number of Decimals in each Position.

- The Base is the same as the Radix.

- The Weight is the Base and the Power Of.

- The Power Of is the number of the Position.

- Integers to the left, Fractionals to the right.

- Decimal: Has no Value.

- Binary: [1 = (on, yes, true, high)], or, [0 = (off, no, false, low)]. = 1 bit.

- Nibble = 4 bits.

- Octal: 8 bits = 1 byte.

- 2 bytes (16 bits) = Word.

- Hexadecimal: Prefix = 0x, Suffix = h.

- Little Endian = Least significant byte first.

- Big Endian = Most significant byte first.

```
